	<p>Net Operating Income (NOI) is a property's income after being reduced by vacancy and credit loss and all operating expenses. If this is a positive value, it is referred to as net operating income, while a negative value is called a net operating loss (NOL).</p>
	<p style="text-align: center;">
		<strong>NOI = (GSI x VCL) - OE</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		Example: 
	</p>
		<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
			<li><i><strong>GSI</strong></i> is the total Gross Scheduled Income</li>
			<li><i><strong>VCL</strong></i> is the estimated percentage of Vacancy and Credit Loss</li>
			<li><i><strong>OE</strong></i> is the Operating Expenses</li>
		</ul> 
	
	<p>
		NOI is often viewed as a good measure of property performance and is one of the most important calculations relevant to real estate investment.
