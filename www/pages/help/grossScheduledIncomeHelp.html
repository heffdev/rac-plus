			<p>Gross scheduled income is considered as the gross income that would be collected from a rental property with all units 100% occupied and rented. That is, it is the amount of annual rental income that would be collected if the property experienced zero vacancy and credit loss. To make this happen, vacant units (if they exist) are included in the calculation at a fair market rent.</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;">
				<strong>Gross Scheduled Income = O + V</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Where: 
			</p>
				<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
					<li><i><strong>O</strong></i> is the total income of occupied units</li>
					<li><i><strong>V</strong></i> is the total amount of vacant units, if they were to be rented at fair market prices</li>
				</ul> 
			
			<p>
				In other words, if you have a rental income property consisting of eighty units with two units vacant where the occupied units are currently rented for $740 and you feel the market rent should be $750. You would compute the GSI by showing the occupied units at their current rent of $740 and the vacant units at $750.
			</p>
			<p>78 units occupied @ 740 = 692,640</p>
			<p>+ 2 vacant units @ 750 = 18,000</p>
			<p>GSI = 710,640</p>
